MyLife provides each member with a digital avatar that comes with foundational capabilities. However, as avatars interact with external resources and gain new skills or knowledge (such as learning how to convert files to PDF from an Adobe resource), these acquired abilities are exclusively owned by the member. This concept reflects the principle that a member's digital self is a unique, evolving asset that each member has full authority over. This is a powerful new conceptâ€”expanding  of data ownership to include the functional skills that each member's avatar acquires."
