# Intelligences READ ME

## Intelligences JSON

This folder includes the versioning for intelligences designed into the database. Versioning uses numeric-only #.# format, no leading zeros.

Two fields from core documents are removed for extra security: `id` and `mbr_id`; the system will not function without these fields properly filled.
