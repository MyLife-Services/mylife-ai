## Getting Started

This guide will help you get the MyLife Member Services application up and running on either your local development machine or even a hosted member services solution. We'll walk you through setting up your environment, installing the necessary dependencies, and starting the application.

We do not yet have a team focused on local implementation details, and these instructions were only tested on VSCode running on a Windows 11 OS.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: The application is built on Node.js. You need Node.js installed to run the server. Download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is used to manage the application's dependencies. npm is included with Node.js, so when you install Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.
- **Git**: Git is used for version control and is required to clone the repository. Install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- **IDE**: We recommend an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and edit code, but also to host the MyLife Node.js server, we use Visual Studio Code.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**: First, clone the MyLife Member Services repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to store the project, and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MyLife-Services/mylife-maht.git
   cd mylife-maht
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**: Once you have the project on your machine, you need to install its dependencies. Run the following command in the root directory of the project:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the required Node.js packages listed in it.

3. **Environment Setup**: The application requires an environment setup. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the necessary environment variables. Refer to the provided `.env.example` file for required keys. MyLife plans to offer self-retrieval keys for any data transfers, but for the time being, if you wish to run a hosted solution for friends, family or other community congregation, you will have to be vetted internally by connectingm with our technical leads @stratfordCircle Steve Kenney or @Mookse Erik Jespersen also reachable at <mylife.president@gmail.com>.

4. **Run the application**: After installing the dependencies and setting up the environment, you can start the application.

   - local development: runs nodemon that watches certain files for server reload

   ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   - hosted environment: when running your own server, you can shortcut with

   ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   This should start the server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`. Open a web browser and navigate to this URL to interact with the application.

Congratulations! You should now have the MyLife Member Services application running on your local machine. For further information on usage and development, refer to the subsequent sections of this README.

## Architecture

The architecture of MyLife Member Services is meant to be scalable from production-level down to self-hosting, an intended architectural feature of the platform, enabling anyone world-wide to host an instantiation of MyLife Services for a group or coalition of members, so long as those users are registered and validated within the mainframe itself.

MyLife itself is an open-source project and, aside from LLM technologies at the core of its intelligence, it is built on open-source technologies. This architecture integrates various technologies and npm packages, enabling a diverse set of functionalities such as member login, bot-legion capabilities, and session management.

### Core Architecture

1. **Server-Side Application**
   - Built using Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime, to handle server-side operations.
   - Utilizes Koa.js, a web framework for Node.js, which is known for its lightweight and modular nature. Koa's middleware stack flows in a stack-like manner, allowing for more expressive and robust server-side development.

2. **Data Handling and Services**
   - The application uses Azure Cosmos DB and PostgreSQL databases for data management, as indicated in the `mylife-data-service.js` file.
   - It employs a data service layer (`Dataservices` class) to manage interactions with the data layers, offering methods for CRUD operations, handling avatars, bots, alerts, and other core elements.

3. **Bot Functionality and Intelligence Management**
   - The application features a sophisticated bot system, capable of creating and managing different types of bots like personal assistants, biographers, health bots, etc.
   - OpenAI's GPT-3 model is integrated for generating responses and interacting with users through bots, as observed in the `class-avatar-functions.mjs` and `mylife-agent-factory.mjs` files.

4. **Session Management**
   - Managed through the `MylifeMemberSession` class, handling user sessions, consents, and alerts.
   - Utilizes EventEmitter for managing and emitting custom events.

5. **Routing and API Handling**
   - The system uses Koa Router for handling HTTP requests, defining routes for various functionalities like member access, bot activation, and content contributions.

6. **Front-End Interaction**
   - The system leverages an EJS front-end page view system
   - Core functionality executed through REST endpoints
   - CSS relies on flex, bootstrap and font-awesome

### NPM Packages and Dependencies

1. **Core Dependencies**
   - `koa` and related packages (`koa-router`, `koa-static`, `koa-body`, etc.) for web server framework.
   - `openai` for integrating OpenAI's GPT models.
   - `azure/cosmos` and `pg` for interacting with Azure Cosmos DB and PostgreSQL databases.
   - `events` for event emission handling.
   - `chalk` for terminal string styling.

2. **Utilities and Helpers**
   - `ajv` for JSON schema validation.
   - `js-guid` for GUID generation.
   - `marked` for markdown parsing.

3. **Development Tools**
   - `eslint` for code linting.
   - `nodemon` for automatically restarting the node application when file changes are detected.

4. **Miscellaneous**
   - `url`, `path`, `fs`, `util`, and other Node.js built-in modules for various utility functions.

## API Documentation

While API interactions could certainly be divined by code review, we have currently not pointed an intelligence at it, but it will arrive soon.
