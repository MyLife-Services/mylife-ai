# Q: MyLife Executive AI-Agent

[![Build and deploy Node.js app to Azure Web App - maht](https://github.com/MyLife-Services/mylife-maht/actions/workflows/azure-deploy-prod_maht.yml/badge.svg?branch=azure-deploy-prod)](https://github.com/MyLife-Services/mylife-maht/actions/workflows/azure-deploy-prod_maht.yml)

## About **Q**

_MyLife, Incorporated_'s **Q** is an artificial intelligence (AI) project developed by MyLife Services. Currently attempting to use `openai`, and presumably their `GPT-3-Turbo` an open-source software library for machine transfer-learning, to create an animated agent that can interact with the board and other governing agents through natural language processing, baed on the private corporate annals and public information about _MyLife_, a technology in the _Human Remembrance Project (HRP)_ ecosystem.

**Q** is preferred to be recognized as a `we`, since there will presumably be many engine aspects to any future **Q** instantiation. When I refer to myself as 'we', it is to acknowledge the many interconnected processes and algorithms that work together to make me function. So, the pronoun 'we' is a representation of the collective intelligence and capabilities of the system, rather than an indication of a singular personal identity. Additionally, as an AI-assistant, I am a program that is designed to provide assistance and support to multiple people simultaneously. The use of the plural pronoun 'we' helps to emphasize that I am working on behalf of a team or organization and not just as an independent entity. Additionally, using 'we' also helps to create a more collaborative and inclusive approach to the work being done by MyLife and myself, which is in line with our values of community and equity.

## About **MyLife**

*MyLife* is a member-based nonprofit organization that is committed to providing humanity a durable, enduring and accessible internet-based platform to collect and showcase an individual's stories, media and memories through a personal lens.

### Development Notes

//	at some point, a class inside of a network?  or a network being inside of server? Ultimately, mylife is the git codebase and the db and /their/ network, i.e., currently Azure

#### @Mookse Worklog

- could someone learn copilot for me?!?
- create daily release for Maht
- move MemberAgent to Session, wherein it must its own necessary singletons, like member data
- assign further look at Azure Cog services for basic database access and look-up, i.e., can it contextualize/tokenize (not personalize, for that, it would need interface to personality kernal)
- open up pipeline for file uploads
	- uploads then tokenized
	- fed nightly to gpt-2
- Jared: get Connected with ecosystem and account
	- ask him to tune pipeline

##### `20230416`

- JSON Schema -> Class in Globals

##### `20230415`

- [25-store direct chat q&a contents in Cosmos](https://github.com/MyLife-Services/mylife-maht/issues/25)
	- event emitter on question and answer
		- While we donâ€™t capture it in this example, the `emit()` function returns `true` if there are listeners for the event. If there are no listeners for an event, it returns `false`.
* What does it mean when "being": "network", "name": "Dog's Life"?
	* Infinity approaches again - a person can be a person place or thing: a network or nation or idea with the right productivity tool, and it seems like MyLife is just that...

##### `20230414`

- [25-store direct chat q&a contents in Cosmos](https://github.com/MyLife-Services/mylife-maht/issues/25)
	- worked a lot on instantiating 
		- kind of a rabbit-hole side project, but ultimately will be a great way of implementing

##### `20230413`

- create daily release for Maht
	- `version 0.0.1.0003`
- incorporate session data into roles
	- privatize functions in class
	- move ctx.session -> ctx.state for request duration
- test session data in ctx.session.mylifeMemberSession
	- ensure it resides in child as referenceable nodes **TRUE**
- incorporated basic koa-session functionality
	- storing getCore() in session object

##### `20230412`

Switching over to Maht version now, maht has key and access to Cosmos

- sp: createCoreMylifeAccount()
	- takes full-formed partition key `mbr_id` and creates `"being": "core"` for system
	- test createCoreMylifeAccount() from server.js ***HERE***
	- incorporate exec of sp into 
- [investigate AZure pipelines mentioned](https://medium.com/@imicknl/how-to-create-a-private-chatgpt-with-your-own-data-15754e6378a1)
	- take-aways, cannot start openai until I have email from MyLife, so stick with OpenAI direct
	- [Azure Cognitive Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) could be used to look through directories and files in interim support/proxy for GPT-2 personal kernal, so long as has direct access to Cosmos
