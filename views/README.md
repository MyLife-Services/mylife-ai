# Maht Frontend Client

## Overview

This is the frontend client for Maht, a chatbot that uses GPT-3 to answer questions about MyLife. Of course, this could/should be swapped out with any evolving ui that makes sense from a personalization persepective.

### Layout

Using `KOA-EJS` as the framework, so relying on folder `views` rendering out `layout.html` => `index.html`

## Development

## UX suggestions

- Create a background video, or at least something that pulses while gpt is in operation, I.e., talking with server
- like gpt-3, create stream (also requires much backend) [ISSUE #1](https://github.com/MyLife-Services/mylife-maht/issues/1)
- buttons across as navigation for chat suggestions:  [ISSUE #2](https://github.com/MyLife-Services/mylife-maht/issues/2)
  - What is a digital self?
  - Tell me about MyLife
  - Who founded
  - Mission
  - Values
- logo for Maht
- incorporate logo for MyLife

again, a lot of these structures would come from the GPT-2 instance as tokenized requests to pass to GPT-turbo
