        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to MyLife, where your privacy, security, and control over your data are at the core of our mission. As a nonprofit, MyLife is dedicated to creating a platform where members can share their stories, insights, and experiences within a protected and transparent environment. This Privacy Policy explains in detail how we collect, use, store, and share your information, and it reflects our commitment to data sovereignty and transparency in all interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            At MyLife, each member is an equal <em>core stakeholder</em>, holding both rights and influence over how their data is managed. We empower our members to decide how their data is collected, used, and shared within the platform. Our commitment extends beyond simply protecting your data; we aim to provide you with full ownership and control over it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our privacy policy is designed to be dynamic and evolving, frequently reviewed to align with our constitutional and bylaw obligations. This ensures that our policies adapt to new challenges, technologies, and member insights. As we grow, MyLife will introduce direct voting mechanisms, volunteer opportunities, and microwork participation, empowering members to actively shape platform policies, including privacy. Our ultimate goal is to establish a collaborative and secure digital space where every member's voice contributes to the future of MyLife.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="data-ownership" class="privacy-section">
        <h3>Member Knowledge Ownership</h3>
        <h4>Each Member owns their digital knowledge<br /><em>MyLife</em> is merely a steward</h4>
        <p>
            MyLife recognizes inidividual data and knowledge sovereignty as the right of each member to be the ultimate authority over their data and intelligences. Members have unrestricted access to their data at any time and can decide where it is stored, how it is used, and who can interact with it. MyLife provides no barriers to intelligence access, but does currently rely on all external intelligences.
        </p>
        <p>
            This involves the member's ability to export their data and avatar knowledge seamlessly to alternative platforms or personal repositories whenever they choose, reinforcing the notion that their data remains under their direct control, not locked within the MyLife platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            MyLife utilizes a container-based NoSQL system architecture to store each member's data. This means that all personal documents, history, and contributions are organized within a unique data blade for each member. This setup not only makes it easy for members to access and retrieve their data but also ensures that each member's information is logically isolated from others.
        </p>
        <h4 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h4>
        <p>
            MyLife collects data through the use of intelligent non-human bots, and the process is transparently communicated to members. Bots collect personal data exclusively from their associated Member. This personal data includes a wide range of information, from basic identifiers to deeply private and personal data. The collection of this data is with Member consent and is essential for the services we provide.
        </p>
        <h4 id="data-sharing">Data Sharing</h4>
        <p>
            At MyLife, data sharing is designed to be fully controlled by the member. Data is never shared without explicit, contextual consent, and members have granular control over who can view, interact with, or use their data. Data sharing supports MyLife members in:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Creating and Managing Your Digital Avatar and MyLife Account</b>: Your data enables the creation of a digital avatar, a unique, interactive extension of yourself and protector of your experience and data within MyLife. This avatar reflects your stories, insights, and personality, allowing you to share your authentic self in the ways you choose.
                </li>
                <li><b>Sharing with Posterity</b>: One of MyLife's core purposes is to allow members to leave a legacy for future generations. Data you choose to share with posterity becomes a remembered part of the human experience, preserving your loves, values, and insights for your descendants and the broader community.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Members have a range of controls to manage the visibility and accessibility of their data:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contextual Consent Through Natural Conversations</b>: MyLife uses natural, conversational prompts to request consent in real-time. When opportunities arise to share data for new purposes (e.g., community insights, creative initiatives), MyLife will directly ask for your permission, ensuring you're fully aware of and in control of each data use instance.</li>
                <li><b>Access Permissions</b>: MyLife allows members to specify who can view each piece of content, from personal stories to interactions with other members, through simple, intuitive permission settings.
                </li>
                <li><b>Consent Intelligence</b>: Embedded within each member's digital avatar is a Consent Agentâ€”an intelligent mechanism that reviews and approves any external data requests on your behalf. The Consent Agent ensures that all incoming requests for data access align with your pre-set preferences, notifying you and seeking your direct approval if a new type of request or an unfamiliar entity is involved. This agent acts as a vigilant layer of protection, consistently advocating for your data-sharing preferences and maintaining full transparency on all access events within MyLife.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4 id="data-monetization">Data Monetization</h4>
        <p>
            Because we are a nonprofit organization, we do not use your data for commercial purposes. Each member, however, retains the right to leverage their <em>own personal</em> data, anonymous or identified, for commercial purposes and benefit. Examples of this might include:
            <ul>
                <li>Offer genetic or first-hand accounting to Medical Research organizations</li>
                <li>Allow your avatar auto-connect with designated corporate marketing services</li>
                <li>Provide artistic services to other members or outside agents</li>
                <li>...and much more over time!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <section id="functionality-ownership" class="privacy-section">
        <h3>Member Avatar Functionality Ownership</h3>
        <p>
            At MyLife, members are <em>not only</em> the sole owners of their personal data but also of the skills and functionalities that their avatars acquire or develop. MyLife provides each member with a digital avatar that comes with foundational capabilities. However, as avatars interact with external resources and gain new skills or knowledge (such as learning how to convert files to PDF from an Adobe resource), these acquired abilities are exclusively owned by the member. This concept reflects the principle that a member's digital self is a unique, evolving asset that each member has full authority over.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's explore this powerful new conceptâ€”expanding data ownership to include the functional skills that each member's avatar acquires.
        </p>
        <h4>Key Aspects of Functional Capability Ownership</h4>
        <ol>
            <li id="avatar-skills">Inherent and Acquired Skills: Every avatar starts with core functionalities granted by MyLife, like the storage of memories, entries and other personalized data interactions. As the avatar learns new skills from external resources or member requests (e.g., formatting documents, engaging with creative tools), these learned capabilities become part of the member's unique, personal skill set. MyLife ensures that any new skill or tool learned by the avatar is fully under the member's control and can be customized, expanded, or removed at the member's discretion.</li>
            <li id="avatar-personalization">Customization and Personalization of Skills: Members can personalize their avatar's abilities to suit their own preferences, reflecting the distinctive ways each member may wish to engage with their digital self. Whether adding new functionalities or refining existing ones, members retain full authority to manage their avatar's skills, deciding how they function, interact, and grow.</li>
            <li id="avatar-knowledge">Exclusive Access to Functional Knowledge: Any knowledge or skill acquired by the avatar is exclusive to the member, ensuring that the member has sole ownership and control over the advanced functions their avatar possesses. This exclusive access extends to all processes, workflows, and tools that the avatar learns, reinforcing the member's authority over their digital self.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            We anticipate periodic knowledge acquisition reviews and consensual frameworks to emerge that support Avatar-to-Avatar skill learning.
        </p>

    <section id="data-leverage" class="privacy-section">
        <h3>How MyLife Uses Member Data</h3>
        <p>
            Our constitution prohibits the use of your data for commercial purposes. All of the learning your Member Avatar and its team of intelligences is for the benefit of your experience, and is not directly shared with any other internal entities or intelligences, so that your experience is unique to you.
        </p>
        <h4 id="technical-support">Technical Support</h4>
        <p>
            When a member encounters a technical issue or error on the platform, MyLife may temporarily access specific data points related to that issue to diagnose and resolve the problem. This use is purely for troubleshooting purposes, and access is limited to relevant data needed to assist with error resolution.
        </p>
        <h4 id="service-testing">Service Improvements and Testing</h4>
        <p>
            MyLife occasionally seeks member consent to use certain data insights for targeted service improvements, such as testing new features or optimizing interface elements based on specific, volunteered feedback. This usage is opt-in and might involve aggregating anonymous data solely from consenting members to refine usability or address member-requested enhancements.
        </p>
        <h4 id="threat-detection">Threat Detection and Security</h4>
        <p>
            MyLife may use member data to ensure security standards and to safeguard the platform and membership against misuse. This includes monitoring for account authenticity, preventing unauthorized access, and identifying unusual activity that could signal a security risk.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="data-retention" class="privacy-section">
        <h3>Data Retention</h3>
        <p>
            MyLife is dedicated to preserving member data indefinitely, ensuring that each member's stories, insights, and contributions endure as part of a shared human legacy. The retention of data goes beyond simple storage; it involves safeguarding the data under evolving technological, ethical, and custodial standards. MyLife's retention policy includes the unique role of the digital avatar as an eternal custodian and specific protocols for corporate continuity.
            <ul>
                <li id="eternal-custodian"><em>Eternal Custodian</em>: Upon a member's passing, their avatar transitions into the role of a data custodian, a faithful representative that continues to uphold the member's legacy. If the member has given consent, the avatar will interact with future generations and continue to acquire skills necessary to respond to inquiries or perform memorial tasks as requested by the member's family or authorized individuals. This ensures the member's digital presence remains alive, meaningful, and capable of honoring their original intentions.</li>
                <li id="organizational-continuity"><em>MyLife Organizational Continuity</em>: MyLife is structured as a nonprofit dedicated to providing a permanent digital platform for human legacies. Should MyLife ever face operational challenges, we have secured contingencies for members to transfer custodianship of all member data to one of several trusted, like-minded nonprofit organizations.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="data-security" class="privacy-section">
        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>
            Currently, MyLife leverages OpenAI predominantly for its LLM functionality. With the current implementation and licensing accords, OpenAI is not allowed to train its models on MyLife data. While we recognize this contract as a useful agent in ensuring security, below we explain further techniques to prevent nonconsensual usage.
        </p>
        <h4 id="engineering">Platform Engineering Philosophy</h4>
        <p>
            MyLife's system is architected and engineered with the principles of revealing the minimum possible context to any external or internal LLMs, preserving privacy by default. This design limits the scope of data accessible to external systems, ensuring that only essential and specific data segments are available as required for functional tasks.
        </p>
        <h4 id="aggregator">Aggregator Model</h4>
        <p>
            As an aggregator of various LLM models, MyLife employs a distributed data processing model to enhance security and privacy. By segmenting data processing tasks across multiple, separate models, MyLife ensures that no single LLM has comprehensive access to any member's data, reducing potential exposure and enhancing privacy. This distributed approach maximizes security while allowing us to tailor processing to the specific needs of each task.
        </p>
        <h4 id="threading">Thread Model</h4>
        <p>
            Additionally, <em>inside</em> of each LLM, MyLife employs strict management protocols for interactions, ensuring that threads and runs are carefully isolated to prevent unintended data sharing. Each thread is securely managed within a compartmentalized environment, minimizing exposure and protecting the privacy of member information. MyLife can delete external content at the thread level once the contextual inteliigence is no longer essential (in the sense that it can be restored from MyLife conversational data) to ensure that member content is not used for external model training.
        </p>
        <h4 id="decentralized">Decentralized, Scalable Infrastructure</h4>
        <p>
            MyLife's data architecture is designed to be both extensible and decentralized, allowing the platform to scale securely as member needs grow. While the official MyLife hosted environment has its own centralized database in the cloud, it can be independently run and hosted anywhere. This decentralized offering increases resilience against data breaches, ensuring that member data remains safe and accessible across a distributed network.
        </p>
        <h4 id="data-compliance">Data Compliance</h4>
        <p>
            MyLife intends to adhere to GDPR, CCPA, and other international privacy and security regulations, ensuring that our data handling practices meet or exceed legal requirements. This includes providing members with rights over their data, such as access, correction, and deletion, and ensuring that all security practices are fully compliant. Additional resources will be needed to build out this compliance, and we are actively seeking volunteers to help us in this area.
        </p>
        <h4 id="data-deletion"></h4>
        <p>
            Members have flexible deletion options, allowing them to delete specific data segments, reset data sets, or remove all data. Additionally, members receive notifications about data refreshes during platform updates, giving them the opportunity to review and adjust their data-sharing settings whenever new features are introduced.
        </p>
        <h4 id="security-plans">Security Plans and Builds</h4>
        <p>
            MyLife operates with its own security hardness scale, and while we released our closed alpha with `talc` we are currently planning and processing the next security framework: `gypsum`. This is one way in which we demonstrate that the safety and security of your evolving data are paramount to us.
